### **The Pitch (Under 3 Minutes)**

**Minute 1: The Problem & The Vision (The Hook)**

*   **(30s) Opening:** "Hi, we're Team ProdAIve. Cement plants are stuck in a reactive loop, wasting energy and materials because of information delays. We're changing that by building a proactive, AI-powered co-pilot for the plant operator."

*   **(30s) The Solution:** "Our platform, ProdAIve, uses a predictive model on **Vertex AI** to anticipate quality issues hours in advance. We fuse data from across the plant into **BigQuery** to enable true cross-process optimization, directly addressing a core goal of this hackathon."

**Minute 2: The Innovation (The "Wow" Factor)**

*   **(60s) The Agentic AI:** "But our key innovation is the **Agentic AI Assistant**, powered by **Gemini**. It's not a chatbot. When an anomaly is predicted, the assistant takes control. It proactively alerts the operator, orchestrates the UI to pinpoint the problem's source, and provides instant access to the relevant SOP. It tells a clear story from detection to resolution. This is the future of industrial control."

**Minute 3: The Ask & The Roadmap (The Strategic Question)**

*   **(30s) Status & Roadmap:** "We have a polished frontend and a deployed ML pipeline. Our next step is full integration. Our architecture is ready to expand to other areas like optimizing alternative fuels."

*   **(30s) The Strategic Question:** "As we plan for production-level data throughput, our key strategic question is this: **For our backend, would you recommend scaling our current FastAPI service, or should we adopt an event-driven architecture using Google Cloud Functions for maximum scalability and efficiency?**"
