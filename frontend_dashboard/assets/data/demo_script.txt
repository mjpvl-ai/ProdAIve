Hello everyone. Today, I'm presenting the ProdAIve Dashboard, an intelligent platform designed to monitor, analyze, and optimize industrial processes. It's built with React, TypeScript, and Material-UI to provide a modern, responsive, and data-rich experience. The live version is already deployed and accessible.

What you see here is the main Overview dashboard, which gives us a high-level summary of key performance indicators across the plant. The layout is clean and card-based for clarity. Navigation is handled through this unified Header Bar. We can seamlessly switch between different specialized views. Here we monitor the operational health of our kilns in real-time. This view tracks energy consumption against our targets. And here, we use predictive models to forecast product quality. Notice the smooth, animated transitions between views, designed to create a fluid user experience. Each chart is also interactive. For a more detailed look, you can simply click on any chart to expand it into a focused, full-screen view. This is great for detailed analysis during team meetings.

Now, let's see the 'AI' in ProdAIve in action. The system continuously monitors for anomalies. I'm going to simulate an alert that the system has just detected. As you can see, an anomaly has been detected. Two things just happened automatically: First, our Gemini AI Assistant has opened on the right with a critical alert: 'High temperature spike detected in Kiln! Recommend reducing fuel rate.' Second, the main view has automatically switched to the Process Flow diagram, and the specific node where the issue occurred—the 'Kiln Burning' stage—is now highlighted. This immediately shows us where the problem is. This guided workflow takes the guesswork out of troubleshooting. The AI doesn't just tell you what's wrong, it shows you where it's happening.

The AI Assistant is more than just an alert system; it's an interactive partner. It can provide deeper insights, generate reports, or even navigate the app for you based on your requests. The panel itself is flexible. We can toggle it fullscreen for an immersive chat experience or hide it completely to focus on the data.

In summary, the ProdAIve dashboard combines real-time, multi-faceted monitoring; a highly interactive and intuitive user interface; and powerful, proactive AI-driven insights that guide users from problem detection to resolution. The core frontend structure is complete, and our next step is to integrate with live backend services to power this dashboard with real-time production data. Thank you.
