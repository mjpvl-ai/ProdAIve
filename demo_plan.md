### 1. Introduction (0:00 - 0:20)

*   **Visuals:** Logo, shots of a modern cement plant, animated graphic showing the problem (time delay in quality control).
*   **Narration:** "The cement industry faces a critical challenge: a time lag in quality control that leads to inefficiency and waste. We're Team ProdAIve, and we've built a solution to change that."

---

### 2. The ProdAIve Dashboard (0:20 - 0:50)

*   **Visuals:** Screen recording of the main `Overview` dashboard. Show the high-level KPIs and the clean, modern interface.
*   **Narration:** "This is ProdAIve, an intelligent dashboard that provides a real-time, comprehensive view of cement plant operations. It's designed for plant operators, engineers, and managers to gain immediate insights into plant performance."

### 3. AI-Powered Anomaly Detection and Guided Troubleshooting (0:50 - 1:40)

*   **Visuals:**
    *   A simulated alert for a high kiln temperature appears on the dashboard.
    *   The `GeminiAIAssistant` automatically opens with the alert and a recommendation.
    *   The view switches to the `Process Flow`, highlighting the "Kiln Burning" node.
    *   The user clicks on the `KilnHealthOverview` to see a detailed analysis of the kiln's performance.
    *   The user interacts with the AI assistant using the voice interface: "Show me the temperature trend for the last hour."
    *   The AI assistant responds with a chart showing the temperature trend.
*   **Narration:** "But ProdAIve is more than just a dashboard. It's an intelligent partner. When an anomaly is detected, the Gemini AI assistant proactively alerts the operator, provides a recommendation, and guides them to the source of the problem. The user can then deep-dive into the data and even use their voice to ask for more information."
