## ü§ñ Agentic AI Integration Flow

The core innovation of ProdAIve is its **agentic AI**, powered by Google's Gemini model. The AI is not just a passive chatbot; it's an active, intelligent partner that guides the user through complex data analysis and troubleshooting workflows.

The integration flow is designed to be proactive and intuitive:

1.  **Proactive Anomaly Detection**: The system continuously monitors real-time data streams from the industrial process.
2.  **AI-Triggered Alert**: When the backend detects a significant anomaly (e.g., a temperature spike in the kiln), it triggers the AI agent.
3.  **Guided Response**: The Gemini AI Assistant automatically opens in the UI, presenting a clear, concise alert. Simultaneously, it provides a direct link to the relevant Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and pivots the main dashboard view to the exact location of the problem on the Process Flow diagram, highlighting the affected component.
4.  **Conversational Navigation**: The user can then engage with the AI using natural language. For example, asking "Show me the kiln's health details" or "What's the impact on energy consumption?"
5.  **Orchestrated UI Changes**: The AI agent interprets these commands and orchestrates the frontend, seamlessly navigating the user to the correct dashboard (e.g., Kiln Health, Energy Cockpit) with smooth, animated transitions. This creates a fluid "analytical story" where the AI guides the user from problem detection to deep-dive analysis and resolution.
6.  **Interactive & Flexible**: The AI panel is fully interactive, allowing for an immersive chat experience or the ability to hide it to focus solely on the data visualizations.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The ProdAIve platform is composed of three main components that work together to deliver a seamless, data-driven experience:

1.  **Frontend Dashboard**: A modern, responsive web application that serves as the primary user interface for data visualization and interaction.
2.  **Data & ML Pipeline**: A set of scripts and services responsible for data simulation, storage, preprocessing, and model training/deployment on Google Cloud.
3.  **Backend Services (Planned)**: The future API layer that will connect the frontend to the live data pipeline and orchestrate AI assistant interactions.

## üìÇ Project Components

### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Dashboard (`/frontend_dashboard`)

The main web application and user interface for the ProdAIve dashboard. It provides an interactive and visually rich experience for monitoring industrial processes.

*   **Purpose**: To visualize complex industrial data, present AI-driven alerts, and guide users through troubleshooting workflows.
*   **Tech Stack**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Material-UI, Recharts, Reactflow, Framer Motion.
*   **Key Features**: AI Assistant, interactive process flow diagrams, real-time KPI monitoring, and predictive quality dashboards.
*   **Status**: Core UI/UX is implemented with mock data. Ready for backend integration.

> **For detailed setup and development instructions, please see the frontend_dashboard/README.md.**

### üî¨ Data & ML Pipeline (`/mlops`, `/data_simulation`, `/model_training`)

This is the data backbone of the project. It includes scripts for simulating industrial data, managing it in the cloud, and training the machine learning models that power the platform's predictive insights.

*   **Purpose**: To create a realistic data environment and deploy a predictive model for clinker quality.
*   **Tech Stack**: Python, Google BigQuery, Google Vertex AI, Scikit-learn.
*   **Workflow**:
    1.  `simulate_kiln_data.py`: Generates simulated kiln process data.
    2.  `load_data_to_bigquery.py`: Loads the simulated data into a BigQuery table.
    3.  `preprocess_data.py`: Fetches and preprocesses data from BigQuery for training.
    4.  `train_clinker_model.py`: Trains a RandomForest model on the processed data.
    5.  `deploy_model_to_vertex_ai.py`: Deploys the trained model to a Vertex AI endpoint for real-time predictions.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Services (Planned)

This component will serve as the central nervous system of the platform, connecting the frontend to the data pipeline and enabling real-time functionality.

*   **Purpose**: To serve live data from BigQuery to the frontend, handle API requests, and manage the logic for the Gemini AI Assistant.
*   **Tech Stack (Proposed)**: Python (FastAPI/Flask), Google Cloud Functions, or another scalable serverless solution.
*   **Status**: Not yet implemented. This is the next major development phase.

## üöÄ Project Status & Next Steps

The high-level UI/UX design and core frontend structure are complete, with visual enhancements and mock data integration. The initial data and machine learning pipeline has been established and deployed on Google Cloud.

The next crucial step is to **integrate the frontend with actual backend services**. This will involve:

1.  Building a robust API to fetch real-time data from BigQuery.
2.  Connecting the frontend components to this live data feed.
3.  Developing the AI assistant's logic to interact with live data and provide actionable insights based on model predictions from Vertex AI.
