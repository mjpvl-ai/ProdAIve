Hello everyone, and welcome to the ProdAIve Dashboard, an intelligent platform designed to monitor, analyze, and optimize industrial processes. It's built with React and Material-UI to provide a modern, responsive, and data-rich experience. The live version is already deployed and accessible.

This is the main Overview dashboard, our mission control for the entire plant. The layout is clean and card-based, giving us a high-level summary of key performance indicators at a glance. Using the unified Header Bar, we can seamlessly navigate to more specialized views. For instance, we can monitor the real-time health of our kilns... track energy consumption against our targets... or use predictive models to forecast final product quality. Notice the smooth, animated transitions, designed for a fluid user experience. Each chart is also interactive; a simple click expands it into a focused, full-screen view, perfect for detailed analysis during team meetings.

Now, let's see the 'AI' in ProdAIve in action. The system continuously monitors for anomalies, and I'm going to simulate an alert it has just detected. As you can see, two things happened automatically: First, our Gemini AI Assistant opened on the right with a critical alert: 'High temperature spike detected in Kiln! Recommend reducing fuel rate.' Second, the main view automatically pivoted to the Process Flow diagram, highlighting the exact node where the issue occurred—the 'Kiln Burning' stage. This guided workflow takes the guesswork out of troubleshooting. The AI doesn't just tell you what's wrong; it shows you where it's happening.

The AI Assistant is more than just an alert system; it's an interactive partner. It can provide deeper insights, generate reports, or even navigate the app for you based on your requests. The panel itself is flexible. We can toggle it fullscreen for an immersive chat experience or hide it completely to focus on the data.

In summary, the ProdAIve dashboard combines real-time, multi-faceted monitoring; a highly interactive and intuitive user interface; and powerful, proactive AI-driven insights that guide users from problem detection to resolution. The core frontend structure is complete, and our next step is to integrate with live backend services to power this dashboard with real-time production data. Thank you.
